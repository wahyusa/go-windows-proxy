I have some bad experience using Windows 10 proxy settings in my old machine and want to make it easy to access either for win 10 or win 11

Current problem with proxy settings :

- Must search it or find it
- Must open settings -> Proxy settings
- Must click windows logo then search for "Proxy Settings"
- It's hard for non-technical users

Sometimes, I ask why it didn't included direcly in Network / Wi-Fi settings.

So I create my own...

It must be easy to access and to user of course.

## Installation

(TODO)
This is ideally a CLI app, you can just download it and register it in environment variables.

## Usage

(EXPECTATION)
Press Windows + R, type wproxy should show this menu

```bash
Windows Proxy (Admin) - Status OFF
1. ON
2. Configure
3. Cancel & Exit
```

Or It will be _TRAY_ based app with same menu provide easy access.

It may be a _GUI_ app with same menu but easier to access and usable UI.
